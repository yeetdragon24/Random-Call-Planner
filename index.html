				<li><a href="http://fthof-planner.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/">FtHoF planner V1</a> by
					<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RebelKeithy">RebelKeithy</a> (reddit)
					<ul>
						<li>The first version made good use of the code that you can just copy from the cookie clicker
							website and interpreted the code in a way that made the first FtHoF planner. Basic but a
							powerful start.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://messieurs.github.io/fthofplannerv2/">FtHoF planner v2</a> by
					<a href="https://discord.gg/cookie">@skeezy</a> (discord)
					<ul>
						<li>The second version of the FtHoF planner with undeniable the biggest update to it to date.
							The new version also made it possible to have a look into the Gambler's Fever Dream and a
							combo-finder was added which made it more easy to actually find them.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://eminenti.github.io/FtHoF-Planner-v3/">FtHoF planner v3</a> by
					<a href="https://discord.com/invite/r6hssr5">@eminenti</a> (discord)
					<ul>
						<li>The third version was mainly a bugfix because of a bugfix. The original and second FtHoF
							planners made use (just like the original cookie clicker) of a second possible change to
							alter the outcome of FtHoF. This was a bug and fixed by Orteil. This broke the first 2
							planners and was fixed in V3. Later also the combo-finder was fixed not to calculate those
							outcomes for Gambler's Fever Dream.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<li><a href="https://mylaaan.github.io/FtHoF-Planner-v4/">FtHoF planner v4</a> by
					<a href="https://discord.gg/cookie">@mylaaan</a> (discord)
					<ul>
						<li>The fourth version only added ease of use interface options. Like the "Cast Spell" button to
							make it easier to keep track of where you are without importing the save again. Also updated
							some visual features and removed Google Analytics.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://joseph3079.github.io/FtHoF-Planner-v5/">FtHoF planner v5</a> by
					<a href="https://discord.gg/cookie">@joseph3079</a> (discord)
					<ul>
						<li>The fifth version added a "Random Seed" column, which can be used to see how many onscreen cookies will cause a spell to backfire without needing to change settings repeatedly, and can be used to tell what Gambler's Fever Dream will give when it can't choose all 8 spells. Additionally, it now shows building specials, elder frenzies, and sugar lumps that aren't visible due to a wrong backfire chance.

					<a href="https://discord.gg/cookie">@yeetdragon24</a> (discord)
					<ul>
						<li>The Random Call version is modified to not show FtHoF or GFD outcomes but instead the raw Math.random() values, which can be used to gain more information on all spells cast in addition to just FtHoF and GFD, at the cost of user friendliness..
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>For added features or bugs open an issue on <a
						href="https://github.com/yeetdragon24/Random-Call-Planner/issues">GitHub</a> or make it yourself
					and make a pull request. I will credit you of course.
				</li>
				<li>If you do make a bug report please add the save export. This makes it easier to visualise
					the problem you're facing and I can make sure it is fixed instead of almost being sure.

				<li>
					<b>Force the Hand of Fate is not completely random, it is based on your game's seed (which changes
						after each ascension) and on the number of spells cast this game. This means that if you know
						the seed then you can predict the results for casting Force the Hand of Fate:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>There are two main things that can affect the result of FtHoF, the current season <s>and the
							golden cookie sound selector</s>. If the season is Valentines or Easter the random seed will
							be
							increased once. This means there are 2 possible results for each cast of FtHoF depending on
							the selected season. Continuing to switch between seasons will not affecting the results,
							they only affect the result at the time the spell is cast.
						</li>
						<li>Dragonflight can also affect the results of casting FtHoF. If the buff is active (not just
							possible) when FtHoF is cast then Click Frenzy is not added to the pool of possible results.
							This can change the result even if the original result was not a Click Frenzy.
						</li>
						<li>Another thing that after the result is how many golden cookies are already on the screen.
							Each one increases the chance of failure by 15%.
						</li>
						<li>Since the result of FtHoF is based on the number of spells cast, if the next FtHoF cookie is
							not the one you want, you can cast a different spell to skip this one. This can be useful if
							you are searching for a particular cookie or need to skip a wrath cookie.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<pre>&lt;/RebelKeithy&gt;</pre>
				<pre>&lt;Skeezy&gt;</pre>

				<li>
					<b>Combo search: Once you import a save file, the planner will display both the earliest and
						shortest versions of combos. Combos are combinations of Building Specials (BS) (and optionally
						Elder Frenzies (EF)) that are close together:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Min combo is the smallest combo to search for; Max is the largest.</li>
						<li>Spread is how much leeway to include in the combo search. For example, if you want a 3x
							combo and are ok with a sequence of [BS, non-BS, BS, BS], that would be a combo size of 3
							with a spread of 1, for a total length of 4.
						</li>
						<li>Include Elder Frenzies is asking whether to count EF spawns from FtHoF in your combos. For
							most people these are just as good, if not better than Building Specials, so they're
							included by default. But in some cases you may not want EF via FtHoF, so I have an option to
							exclude it.
						</li>
						<li>For Skip Abominations and Skip Spontaneous Edifices, see below for more explanation, but
							these options are just asking whether to factor in skippable rows when searching for combos.
							Can't imagine why you'd want this off, but I have the option there at least for educational
							purposes.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b>Gambler's fever dream: Added a column for this, as it's critical to getting combos:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>More chances for Building Special or Elder Frenzy via Gambler's -> FtHoF. Plus these casts
							end up costing significantly less mana, which can help with more spread-out combos. Hover
							over the cookie when it's FtHoF to see what the cookie might contain
						</li>
						<li>Allows for more combos by skipping over certain rows when desired. (Abominations and
							successful Spontaneous Edifice casts from Gambler's can both increment your spell counter
							for free, i.e. without costing any mana.)
						</li>
						<li>For the same skipping reason as above, this can help in incrementing your spell counter
							quickly to get to your desired combo.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Lookahead length: This is how many grimoire casts (rows) are loaded when you import (original had it
					hard-coded to 10).
				</li>
				<li>Spell counter column (the one on the left) now includes indices for both your spells casts this
					ascension, and total spells cast
				</li>
				<li>Building Specials and Elder Frenzies are highlighted yellow</li>
				<li>Rows skippable via Gambler's have their Gambler's spell highlighted blue.</li>

				<pre>&lt;/Skeezy&gt;</pre>
				<pre>&lt;Mylaaan&gt;</pre>

				<li>
					<b>Cast Spell and Apply Settings:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The Cast Spell button will forward the whole list 1 spell. It will also apply all settings
							so if you have changed them the outcome for future spells may change. If you have to cast
							FtHoF for a CF first you want to keep that cookie on screen, this way you can up the "Golden
							Cookies on screen" and then cast spell
						</li>
						<li>If you made progress you don't want to click the Import Save button as it will reset your
							manually cast spells. You can use Apply Settings to change stuff up without losing track.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>For early game players the possibility to hide the One change column as they won't have Season
					Switcher
				</li>
				<li>Added a checkbox for the "Supreme Intellect" dragon aura as this should influence the
					positive/negative rate by 10% more negative. This is maybe a bug in the game but currently this
					button is a placebo or a placeholder for future implementation. The game and the planner do
					currently not step out of line when using the aura without any update to the planner.
				</li>
				<pre>&lt;/Mylaaan&gt;</pre>
				
				<pre>&lt;Joseph3079&gt;</pre>
				
				<li>
					<b>Random Seed column:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The Random Seed column shows how much of a backfire chance is required to make a spell backfire. If the random seed is between 0.85 and 1, the spell will backfire with no golden cookies on screen. If the random seed is between 0.7 and 0.85, it will backfire with 1 golden cookies on screen, but it will succeed with 0 golden cookies on screen.
						</li>
						<li>The same random number is used to determine what spell Gambler's Fever Dream chooses. If you have enough magic for any of the 8 spells to be chosen after paying GFD's cost, a random seed that is between 0 and 1/8 will choose the first spell (Conjure Baked Goods), a random seed that is between 1/8 and 2/8 will choose the second spell (FtHoF), and so on. If you don't have enough magic for GFD and half of the price of Spontaneous Edifice, there will only be 7 eligible spells, so a random seed between 0 and 1/7 will give Conjure Baked Goods, a random seed between 1/7 and 2/7 will give FtHoF, and so on. This might interfere with a GFD that says it will give FtHoF, but at a low enough magic amount it might give CBG instead.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The Supreme Intellect checkbox now actually works. Note that Supreme Intellect and Diminish Ineptitude multiply the base 15% backfire chance, and then the 15% increase in backfire chance per on screen GC is added afterward, so a cast with a successful DI, SI active, and 3 on screen GCs would have a 46.65% chance of backfiring, which would mean any spell with a random seed less than 0.5335 would succeed.
				</li>
